## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.

* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info">

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Filtering

The following describes how the filter command `filter a/Mayor=CS` is executed.

First, `FilterCommandParser` parses a set of attributes (i.e., the pair of `Mayor` and `CS`), creating a new instance of `FilterCommand`. The procedure is almost the same as shown in the [logic component section](#Logic-component). `FilterCommand` is initialized with the attribute(s) and `wasDuplicate`, set `true` when there is a duplicate in input attributes. This boolean parameter is later used to generate a warning message about the duplicate. In this case, this parameter is set `false`.

Next, `FilterCommand::execute(m)` is called. The method consists of three steps:

1. autocorrection of `Mayor` and `CS`,
1. creation and application of filtering predicate, and
1. generation of warning messages.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the method works at the low-level:

<puml src="diagrams/FilterSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="filter a/Mayor=CS" />

To autocorrect the attribute name `Mayor`, the Model goes through the following process:

<puml src="diagrams/AutoCorrection.puml" alt="Autocorrection of 'Mayor'" />

The attribute value `CS` will be autocorrected in a similar way. The only difference lies in case-sensitivity: attribute names are converted to lowercase internally, while attribute values remain unchanged (as per the behavior of `Attribute::getAttributeName/Value`).

Alternatively, if there is no attribute name/value close enough to `Mayor`/`CS`, nothing will be returned from `autocorrectAttributeName/Value`; this is why their return value is `Optional<String>`.

The second parameter for `getWarningForName/Value` (i.e., `corecctedName/Value`) is also `Optional<String>`, meaning the method can also generate a warning message that no candidate has the input attribute name/value. The recommended usage is to pass the return value of `autocorrectAttributeName/Value` directly as this second parameter.

If there are multiple attributes given to the filter command, each attribute will go through the same process as above. Specifically, the command

1. first autocorrects all the attributes,
2. followed by the creation of predicate with the corrected attributes, and
3. obtains warning messages for the entire attribute name/values.

Please also note that, in the actual implementation, the command repeats the autocorrection process during the acquisition of warning messages. This is for the sake of simplicity of code.

### Undo feature

The undo mechanism is implemented inside `Model`. `Model` now implements the following operations:
* `Model#saveState()` - Saves the current address book state in its history. This is executed before every command in `LogicManager`.
* `Model#revertLastState()` - Reverts the address book to the last state in its history.

`Model` stores a `Stack` of `AddressBook`-s. To save the current address book, it creates a copy of the current address book, but copies the `Person` object by reference. This feature therefore requires that `Person` is not modified in-place when editing, but instead re-constructed.

<box type="info">

To prevent the case where an `UndoCommand` does not change the address book, `Model#saveState()` enforces that duplicate address books will not be saved. `Model#revertLastState()` enforces that it will not revert to an `AddressBook` which is equal to the current `AddressBook`, using the Java `Object#equals()` method.

As `AddressBook#equals()` only checks for `UniquePersonList` and `aliasMappings`, only changes to these will be undone.

</box>

The following sequence diagram illustrates how `Model#saveState()` is implemented.

<puml src="diagrams/ModelSaveState.puml" alt="ModelSaveState" />

The following sequence diagram illustrates how `UndoCommand#execute()` is implemented.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

It is noteworthy that although `saveState()` is called before `UndoCommand` gets executed, the undoing still works as `revertLastState()` ensures it will revert to a different `AddressBook`.

### Sort/numerical sort feature

Sorting is currently done via custom comparators. Due to the similarity between the two sort commands, we have two classes that inherit from an abstract class `SortCommand`: `LexSortCommand` for the default alphabetical sort, and `NumSortCommand` for numerical sort.

First, `LexSortCommandParser`/`numSortCommandParser` parses an attribute name and an optional field order parameter, creating a new instance of `LexSortCommand`/`NumSortCommand`. The procedure is almost the same as shown in the [logic component section](#Logic-component). The instance is initialized with the attribute name and a boolean variable `isAscending`, which is set to `true` or `false` depending on the user input. 

Next, `SortCommand::execute(m)` is called. The method consists of three steps:

1. autocorrection of the attribute name,
2. creation and application of sort comparators, and
3. generation of warning messages.

Note that autocorrection in Step 1 uses the same implementation as the one mentioned in the [filtering section](#filtering).

The following sequence diagrams show how a default sort operation "sort a/Location o/ascending" is executed:

<puml src="diagrams/LexSortSequenceDiagram1.puml"></puml>
<puml src="diagrams/LexSortSequenceDiagram2.puml"></puml>

The process of a numerical sort operation "sort-num a/GPA o/descending" is similar to the above, except for comparator used (refer to the diagram below) and an extra call to `Model::numOfPersonsWithNumericalValue` when generating the warning message.

<puml src="diagrams/NumSortSequenceDiagram.puml"></puml>

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.
2. Should be able to hold up to 1000 persons without any noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster by using commands as compared to using the mouse.
4. Logs must be automatically generated.
5. Logs must be identical across different operating systems to enable sharing between the same app on different OS platforms.
6. Copy and paste should be supported in text fields, allowing the user to enter information without typing manually.
7. The app has to respond within one second.

### Glossary

* **Attribute**: A key-value pair associated with a candidate.
  * For example, `Graduation Year: 2027` is an attribute, where the **attribute name** is `Graduation Year` and the **attribute value** is `2027`.
* **Candidate**: Any person in the address book. May be used interchangeably with the term "person".
* **Command**: A string of text that the user enters via the command line.
* **Duplicate**: A string that matches another string exactly, ignoring case.
* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS.
* **Valid email**: A string of characters of the form `{local-part}@{domain}` adhering to the following constraints:
  * `{local-part}` contains only alphanumeric characters and the special characters `+_.-`, and cannot start or end with a special character.
  * `{domain}` consists of _domain labels_ separated by periods (`.`), where the last domain label is at least 2 characters long.
  * Each _domain label_ contains only alphanumeric characters and hyphens (`-`), and cannot start or end with a hyphen.
* **Valid name**: Any sequence containing only whitespace, alphabetical characters, and the special characters `/@`. `/` should only be used in the phrase `s/o` or `d/o`.
